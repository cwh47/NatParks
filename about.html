    <p>The Friends of the National Park is a project that is part capsule, part fun. It was created as a way to inspire all earth-dwellers to get outside and explore. The responses come from a diverse group of people from different backgrounds, cultures, places, and ideas; it is astounding to see that they all share the same sense of pure, uninhibited connection to these places.
        <br>
        <br>I hope that you find their responses to be as empowering, hope-inducing, and soulful as I have. </p>
