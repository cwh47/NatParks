# Friends of the National Parks

##### Friends of the National Parks is a final project created by Chelsea Haina at the University of Miami. The project's goal is to encourage others to get outside and be one with the natural beauty of the earth, and be empowered to do so through the stories of love, friendship, and connection felt by the people featured on the site.
